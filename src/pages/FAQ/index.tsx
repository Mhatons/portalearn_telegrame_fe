                            <li><strong>How does the BOT work?</strong>
                                <p>The BOT is programmed to replicate the trading strategies of multiple expert traders with proven track records. These strategies have been used by the traders in real-time under real market conditions. The BOT replicates these strategies by scanning different live markets and generating a trading signal when the set parameters are met. The BOT then enters the trade based on a fixed risk to ensure consistent profits for your investment.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, the BOT has a huge dataset of actual real trades on different markets from 2021 until this date. It utilizes an AI model to predict trades using mixed popular indicators and very careful and accurate calculations to detect the direction of trade with an accuracy of up to 64-78%. By combining this predictive capability with the replication of trading experts, the BOT guarantees a high winning percentage.</p>

                            <li><strong>Expected earnings</strong>
                                <p>The BOT generates an average daily profit of 2% with a strike rate of above 80%. Under ideal conditions, if a user invests $1000, the expected earnings without any losing day would be as follows:</p>
                                <p>Day 1 - $1000</p>
                                <p>Day 7 - $1149</p>
                                <p>Day 14 - $1319</p>
                                <p>Day 21 - $1515</p>
                                <p>Day 28 - $1741</p>
                                <p>NOTE: Due to the normal distribution of the losing trades, the actual results may vary.</p>

                            <li><strong>How to make an investment?</strong>
                                <p>To start your investment or to add to your current portfolio in our BOT, go to your "My Account" section in our Telegram bot and click "Add Funds". This will generate a USDT payment address. Once the payment is done, you can click on the "Status" button to check whether the payment has been cleared or not. You can also check the payment status from the blockchain explorer. The minimum deposit amount is $25.</p>
                                <p>NOTE: Make sure you add the gas fee in the payment amount. Only the payment received in our wallet address will be added to your balance.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>How to withdraw profits?</strong>
                                <p>To withdraw your money or your entire investment out of the BOT, go to your "My Account" section and click "Withdraw". Enter your wallet address and the desired withdrawal amount. Once the withdrawal ticket is submitted, it will be processed within 5 business days and the transaction id will be generated.

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>What is the fee, or commission, or the cost of using the bot?</strong>
                                <p>Unlike other companies we charge NO monthly fee. The trading commission is standard according to the broker/exchange where the trade is placed. The final profit per trade will be reflected after paying all commission costs. We only charge 15% performance fee for the profits we generate for you as per the industry standards. You do not pay any performance fee for losses, ONLY PROFITS; which means you do not have to deal with any hidden and shady costs like other companies. You can withdraw 80% of all the profits without any additional cost (15% performance + 5% withdrawal).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Exchange/Broker used for trading?</strong>
                                <p>We use multiple reliable brokers and exchanges to place the trade across multiple instruments. For crypto we use reliable exchanges such as Binance, for traditional assets we use regulated brokers like Capital.com which is regulated by FCA and ASIC.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>How are losses managed?</strong>
                                <p>For the conservative risk trading, the daily losses are capped at 2% per day. Under rare trading conditions, if the daily loss is reached, the trading is stopped. This ensures that your PnL remains consistent without unnecessary swings. If you want to choose aggressive/riskier trading for higher rewards, then daily losses are capped at 4% per day.</p>
                            </li>
